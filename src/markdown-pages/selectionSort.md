In computer science, selection sort is an in-place comparison sorting
algorithm.The algorithm divides the input list into two parts: a sorted
sublist of items which is built up from left to right at the front (left)
of the list and a sublist of the remaining unsorted items that occupy the
rest of the list. The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest (or
largest, depending on sorting order) element in the unsorted sublist,
exchanging (swapping) it with the leftmost unsorted element (putting it in
sorted order), and moving the sublist boundaries one element to the right.
